    \item \alert{Domain meta-model to represent Ravenscar systems}
    \item \alert{The ARC code generator to validate said rules}
    \item \alert{Deterministic connectors and their verification}

\subsection{Observations}

\frame {
  \frametitle{Observations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Code generation approach seems sound
    \item AADL and Ada Ravenscar make good match
    \item Code generation saves a lot of time and effort
      \begin{itemize}
        \item GAP case study was re-engineered
        \item AADL model size $\implies$ 750 locs
        \item Generated code $\implies$ 7.2 klocs
        \item 20 threads
        \item Approx. 100 connections
      \end{itemize}
      \pause
    \item The deterministic connector work is a step in the right
      direction for asynchronous control systems
    \item The semantics, though theoretical, could be implemented and
      used for a more systemic verification
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Criticisms}

\frame {
  \frametitle{Critique}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item No distribution facility
    \item No specification of real-time ``transactions''
    \item Transactions will entail having PO call a PO
    \item Data flow verification mechanism can be improved
    \item Semantics need to be transported from wood to silicon
    \item Did not use transformation language like ATL
  \end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Future work \& perspectives}

\frame {
  \frametitle{Future work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All those points listed as a critique
    \item Integrating various functional models into AADL/Ravenscar
    \item Specially interesting, having Simulink model as thread
      callback
    \item Hypertext traceability between model and code
  \end{itemize}
}
